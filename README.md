Road Accidents in India: Analysis & Prediction

Introduction

Road accidents in India continue to be a major public safety concern, causing significant casualties and economic losses each year. Despite various government interventions, traditional statistical methods struggle to accurately capture the complexity of accident-related factors such as road conditions, weather, and traffic density. This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyze and predict accident severity, offering a more precise and adaptive approach to accident prevention.

Problem Statement

Road accidents are influenced by multiple interdependent factors, making it challenging to develop effective preventive measures. Conventional analysis methods fail to identify hidden patterns within accident data, often leading to reactive rather than proactive safety strategies. This study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging machine learning models capable of predicting accident severity based on diverse datasets. The insights derived from these models will assist policymakers in making informed road safety decisions, ultimately reducing accident rates and fatalities.

Importance of Machine Learning in Road Safety

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in predictive analytics, enabling accurate accident prediction and risk assessment. Unlike traditional approaches, ML models uncover intricate relationships among accident-related variables, allowing for data-driven decision-making. Algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks enhance prediction reliability, providing actionable insights for improving road safety measures.

Data Preprocessing and Standardization

A. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of state-wise road accident statistics in India from 2016 to 2020. It includes multiple attributes that contribute to accident trends, such as:

Total accidents per state (2016-2020)

Accidents per lakh population (2017-2020)

Accidents per 10,000 vehicles (2016-2019)

Injury per lakh population (2018-2020)

Injury per 10,000 km of roads (2016-2018)

B. Data Cleaning and Standardization

To ensure data accuracy and consistency, the following preprocessing steps are applied:

Handling missing values: Imputation techniques such as mean/mode replacement.

Feature scaling: Standardization or normalization to maintain uniformity across features.

Outlier detection and removal: Identifying and eliminating anomalies that could distort predictions.

Data transformation: Encoding categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, correlations, and outliers in accident data.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features that enhance model accuracy.

Model Selection: Training and evaluating various ML models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction & Insights: Using the best-performing model to forecast accident severity and provide actionable recommendations.
